= NameCase

  http://namecase.rubyforge.org/

== DESCRIPTION

NameCase is a Ruby implementation of Lingua::EN::NameCase, a library for
converting strings to be properly cased. This is good for converting
denormalized data to human friendly data.

* Example Usage

  NameCase("RON BURGUNDY")  # => Ron Burgundy
  NameCase("MCDONALDS")     # => McDonalds

* Acknowledgements

This library is a port of the Perl library, and owes most of its functionality
to the Perl version by Mark Summerfield. Any bugs in the Ruby port are my
fault.
